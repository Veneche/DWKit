When I moved to Australia more than three years ago, I shipped two large boxes of books all the way from South Africa!</p>\n \n<p>My favourite genre is fantasy, but I do enjoy the occasional murder mystery or drama, if it is intriguing enough.</p>\n<p>My favourite authors are those in the fantasy realm and include Terry Pratchett and Erin Morgenstern. Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels are packed with satirical humour that brighten anyone's day. Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is pure magical wonder.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Please click on any of the sidebar menu options to view parts of my collection by Book, Author or Genre.</p>\n<hr/>\n<br/>\n<p>For a list of Terry Pratchett's novels, <a href=\"https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/\">see here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Terry Pratchett quote of the day:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><em>\"Always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual.\"</em></blockquote>",
